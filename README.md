Tested with a recent version of Chromium. Firefox doesn't have BigInts at the time of writing, but Safari preview release 59 does; I don't know if its repl supports top-level `await`.

1. Allow popups and install and enable (change a setting in Safari?) a CORS extension.
2. Copy code from
- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0joshuaolson1/media-multiverse/master/s.js - SoundCloud
- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0joshuaolson1/media-multiverse/master/b.js - Bandcamp
- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0joshuaolson1/media-multiverse/master/w.js - websites
- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0joshuaolson1/media-multiverse/master/f.js - heh

and paste in a blank tab's developer/JavaScript console (about:blank).
